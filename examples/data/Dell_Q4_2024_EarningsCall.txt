## Rob Williams - SVP, IR

Thanks, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. With me today are Jeff Clarke, Vice Chairman and COO; and Yvonne McGill, CFO. Our earnings materials are available on our IR website, and I encourage you to review these materials, which include a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures.

During this call, unless we indicate otherwise, all references to financial measures are non-GAAP. All growth percentages refer to year-over-year change unless otherwise specified, and all statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in the cautionary statement section of our financial presentation and in our SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements.

Now I'll turn it over to Jeff.

## Jeff Clarke - Vice Chairman & COO

Thanks, Rob. I'll give a brief overview of our results for the fourth quarter and the full year. For Q4, we delivered revenue of $22.3 billion, down 11%, with non-GAAP EPS of $2.20, up 9%. For the full year, revenue was $88.4 billion, down 14%, and non-GAAP EPS was $7.13, down 11%.

For the full year, our ISG business delivered revenue of $32.8 billion, down 13% but with operating income up 6%, and we expanded ISG operating margin by 280 basis points to 14.6%. Our CSG business delivered revenue of $50.6 billion, down 16% but with op income up $168 million, up 5%, and we expanded CSG operating margin by 150 basis points to 6.9%.

Now turning to the fourth quarter. ISG revenue was $9.3 billion, up 10%, with servers and networking revenue of $4.9 billion, up 31%, and we saw storage revenue of $4.4 billion, down 8%. ISG operating income was $1.4 billion, or 14.7% of revenue.

In CSG, revenue was $11.5 billion, down 23%, down 10% sequentially, which was slightly worse than our normal sequential seasonality due to a dynamic promotional environment with elevated channel inventory. Our CSG operating income was $884 million, or 7.7% of revenue. Total company gross margin was $5.3 billion, down 5%, and gross margin as a percentage of revenue was up 160 basis points to 23.7%, driven by improved component costs and strong execution on pricing.

Now let's talk about our FY '25 assumptions. First, we expect the PC market to return to growth. This is in line with third-party research. We see tailwinds from aging installed base, above-average user base, and the shift from buying devices to buying solutions for the PC.

We expect continued storage declines in the first half. We do see second half growth, given easier compares, and we expect servers and networking to grow. We expect improved margins in storage based on what we're seeing today. Our pipeline remains at record levels with no slowdown across the broader portfolio.

I'm excited about the work we're doing to redefine IT in the age of AI. Over the last quarter, we've continued to make great progress on Project Apex. We've made it easier for customers to consume our products as services, with a 40% increase in active subscriptions over the course of the year.

As we turn to AI, we believe our industry is undergoing a substantial technology refresh cycle driven by AI, and we expect that cycle will have a meaningful impact on FY '25. The Dell Technologies analyst meeting is scheduled for September, and we'll share more about our long-term plan then.

Now let me turn it over to Yvonne to discuss our financial results in more detail.

## Yvonne McGill - CFO

Thanks, Jeff. I'll start with a summary of some of the larger business drivers for the fourth quarter. Our deferred revenue balance was $32.7 billion at the end of the fiscal year, up $2.4 billion or 8%. Our remaining performance obligation, or RPO, was $39 billion, up 2% sequentially and down 6% year over year.

From a cash flow and balance sheet perspective, cash flow from operations was strong at $3 billion for the quarter, and for the year, it was $7.7 billion. We ended the quarter with $9.3 billion in cash and investments. Our core debt ended the quarter and the year at $16.1 billion, and total debt ended the quarter at $23.9 billion.

We repurchased approximately 5 million shares of DELL stock in the fourth quarter for about $350 million and 38 million shares for the full year at a total cost of approximately $2.1 billion. In the fourth quarter, we paid $280 million in cash dividends and over $1 billion for the full year.

As we look ahead, we're excited about our opportunity in this AI era. We're helping our customers on their AI journeys from development to deployment across their organizations. We've shipped approximately $2 billion of AI-optimized servers since the introduction of these platforms last May, with growth of more than 40% sequentially in Q4, and our backlog more than doubled in Q4.

For Q1 of FY '25, we expect revenue to be in the range of $21 billion, plus or minus $400 million. This is down 6% to 8% sequentially following typical seasonality in a dynamic market. Diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.20, plus or minus $0.10, down 40% to 50% sequentially.

In closing, I'd like to thank our team members for their dedication to our customers and Dell Technologies.

Now I'll turn it back to Rob to begin the Q&A.

## Rob Williams - SVP, IR

Thanks, Yvonne. Let's get to Q&A. [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Samik Chatterjee at JP Morgan.

## Samik Chatterjee - JP Morgan

Jeff, I know you gave us a bit of a view on what your expectations are in terms of the various verticals and how they will sort of trend through fiscal '25. But if I can maybe ask you more specifically, the AI-optimized server, which you mentioned about $2 billion through this fiscal year, and then the sequential growth rate of 40%, how should we think about that growing into fiscal '25? And just relative to that, how would the mix of the data center business sort of more broadly trend with traditional servers likely at a more moderate trajectory?

## Jeff Clarke - Vice Chairman & COO

Thanks, Samik. Great question. You're asking about the mix of our server business, but more importantly, the AI-optimized servers and the data center as we look into FY '25. We're excited about the prospects of AI. I think I made the comment that we believe it's driving a substantial technology refresh cycle. Think of it in terms of we believe the full-year data center CAGR is about 10% with accelerated servers or AI-optimized servers growing in that 25% CAGR range. That equates to about $7.5 billion in FY '25, and the rest of the data center would be in the high-single-digit growth; let's just assume it's in the 8% range. That's going to keep us busy selling servers and delivering the infrastructure that our customers need.

As far as the mix, I think I would be thinking about AI servers being probably in the 25% to 30% of the server mix across the industry. And we certainly are aiming to be the number one AI infrastructure company in the world, and we believe we're off to a good start. The $2 billion of AI-optimized servers that we've sold since the launch of the product in May is encouraging. The pipeline and the momentum we have in the business is certainly keeping us busy.

## Rob Williams - SVP, IR

Great. Thanks. Next question from Wamsi Mohan at Bank of America.

## Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch

Jeff, when you look at the $2 billion of AI-optimized servers, can you maybe talk about the mix between enterprise and hyperscalers? And just to be double clear, that $2 billion, that's from launch through January, correct?

## Jeff Clarke - Vice Chairman & COO

Thanks, Wamsi. Yes, it's from the launch, which was in late May when we launched both our PowerEdge XE9680 and 8640. It is through the end of our fiscal year, which was February 2nd, so just after January. And I would answer your question very directly: we do not sell to the top six AI hyperscalers. This is all enterprise. This is all Global 2000 customers. This is all our core customer. This is all our core go-to-market engine. This is, quite frankly, what we do well, which is to solve complex enterprise problems.

If you think of the top six hyperscalers out there in the world today, whether it's Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta, they have direct relationships with the chip manufacturers, and they're building a lot of their own and solutions the way they want them. We're focused on solving pretty complex use cases in large organizations who want us to help them design, build, deploy, and support a broad portfolio of infrastructure solutions, and we will continue to do that.

## Rob Williams - SVP, IR

Thanks. Next question from Amit Daryanani at Evercore.

## Amit Daryanani - Evercore ISI

I guess I'm hoping you could talk about the storage side a little bit more. You know, generally, we hear from your large Tier 1 storage peers, and the conversations tend to be fairly optimistic, where we're thinking second-half growth should be very feasible. I'd love to understand, A) why do you think Dell is going to trough later versus others? And B) what's really driving this continued double-digit decline beyond just tough compares? I'm trying to reconcile that versus sort of what we're hearing from your competitors.

## Jeff Clarke - Vice Chairman & COO

Thank you for the question. You hit on it. It's really the compare. I think if you go back and look at FY '23 quarters one and two, our storage business was up double digits in both quarters, and it's against that compare where we see the pressure. With the tougher compare, that certainly is creating a bit of a headwind.

I'll remind you that Q4, as I mentioned, was minus 8%. The prior three quarters were all in the minus teens. So we certainly saw good sequential improvement quarter on quarter. Do we have a plan to continue to improve it? Absolutely. The comments I made about second-half growth take into account that year-over-year compare we have in the second half, which is more favorable.

I think the dynamics that we're experiencing in the storage market are no different than what you hear from others. There's elongation of IT budgets and spending. IT budgets are being stretched, and dollars are going to other locations. A lot of those locations are actually data center power and cooling because we're seeing AI clusters and AI infrastructure take far more power and cooling than traditional. So we're seeing that added expense into companies' IT budgets, which is taking dollars away from spending on things like traditional IT.

We see good opportunities. Our pipeline has never been stronger in the storage space. If we look at our high-end, our PowerMax pipeline is very good, and the activity is around the multi-cloud capabilities that we've built into that. Our PowerStore product continues to perform well, and as we look forward, we think that the initiatives and the pipeline we have in place sets us up for a better second half.

## Rob Williams - SVP, IR

Great. Thank you. And I'll just say, April 4 is the 40-year anniversary of the company. So watch for our celebrations in April.
